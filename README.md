**Zomato Data Insights**

**Overview**
This project is a Streamlit-based application that interfaces with a MySQL database. It allows users to manage and analyze restaurant, customer, order, and delivery data from a Zomato database generated using the Faker library. Zomato Database Project coding.ipynb contains Python scripts to connect to the database, create tables, and insert sample data using the Faker library and follows OOP principles. The "database" class manages MySQL operations, including connecting to the database, creating tables dynamically, and inserting bulk data efficiently. It encapsulates these functionalities using methods like "connect()", "create_table()", and "insert_list_of_tuple()".Streamlit(Zo.py) application supports CRUD Operations, modifications, and custom SQL queries to gain insights into order trends, delivery performance, and customer behavior.

**Features**
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on MySQL tables.
- **Predefined SQL Queries**: Gain insights into order trends, customer activity, delivery efficiency, and restaurant performance.
- **Custom Query Execution**: Run user-defined SQL queries.

**Database Schema**
The MySQL database consists of the following tables:
- "Customers": Stores customer details
- "Orders": Stores order information
- "Restaurants": Stores restaurant details
- "Deliveries": Stores delivery records
- "DeliveryPersons": Stores delivery personnel information

**Predefined SQL Queries**
The application includes 20 predefined queries for insights such as:
1. **Busy Ordering Hours** – Identifies peak hours when most orders are placed.  
2. **Top Ordering Locations** – Lists locations with the highest number of orders.  
3. **Delayed Deliveries** – Shows orders delivered later than the estimated time.  
4. **Cancelled Orders** – Counts the number of canceled orders.  
5. **Customer with Most Orders** – Finds customers who have placed the most orders.  
6. **Top 10 Customers** – Identifies the highest-spending customers.  
7. **Average Delivery Time** – Calculates the average delivery time.  
8. **Best Delivery Personnel** – Ranks delivery personnel based on average ratings.  
9. **Most Popular Restaurants** – Lists restaurants with the most orders.  
10. **Most Popular Cuisines** – Identifies the most frequently ordered cuisine types.  
11. **Average Order Value** – Calculates the average amount spent per order.  
12. **Total Revenue per Restaurant** – Determines the revenue generated by each restaurant.  
13. **Frequent Order Status** – Analyzes the most common order statuses (e.g., completed, cancelled).  
14. **Total Deliveries per Delivery Person** – Shows the number of deliveries handled by each delivery person.  
15. **Highest Delivery Fee** – Finds the maximum delivery fee charged.  
16. **Total Revenue from Premium Customers** – Calculates total revenue generated from premium customers.  
17. **Restaurant with Highest Ratings** – Identifies the restaurant with the best average ratings.  
18. **Most Frequent Payment Mode** – Determines the most commonly used payment methods.  
19. **Top 5 Restaurants by Rating** – Lists the top 5 highest-rated restaurants.  
20. **Top 5 Customers by Orders** – Shows the top 5 customers based on order frequency.  

**Users can also input their own SQL queries for custom analysis.**
